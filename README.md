## MXChip IoT DevKit
The DevKit board features ARM Cortex-M processors. At its core, it comes with a SoC module that combines the power of the ST Microelectronics [STM32F412](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/group0/4f/7b/2b/bd/04/b3/49/25/DM00180369/files/DM00180369.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00180369.pdf) processor and Cypress [BCM43362](http://www.cypress.com/file/297991/download) for WiFi. For on-board peripherals, it has an OLED screen, headphone and speaker output, stereo microphone and abundant sensors such as humidity & temperature, pressure, motion (accelerometer & gyroscope) and magnetometer.
